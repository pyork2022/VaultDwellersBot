*create quizzes\?\*,Oh\,\ absolutely! It's like Fallout\,\ but with your brain as the Wasteland. You give me the details—what you’re studying\,\ your preferred question type\,\ and difficulty.

Multiple Choice\,\ True/False\,\ Short Answer\,\ or even Scenario-Based questions\,\ with XP rewards depending on difficulty. Time limits vary from 20 seconds to 3 minutes\,\ but don’t worry\,\ there’s a perk for every level-up: Intelligence Boost\,\ Agility Perk\,\ and even a Luck Perk. Finish a quiz? Boom\,\ bonus XP. It’s that easy.

*study habits\?\*,SPECIALize: Focus on Strengths and Perks. Morning (Action Points) or night (Night Person perk)? Study when Intelligence is maxed.

Aim carefully\,\ take one shot at a time. Level Up Regularly: Set milestones for XP gain. Reward with Nuka-Cola after a good grind. Rad-Free Zone: Study in a clean\,\ quiet place. Too much radiation (noise) will sap your Intelligence. Stay focused\,\ Sole Survivor—success is out there.
