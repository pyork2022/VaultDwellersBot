*is Skyrim on sale right now on steam*,Oh\,\ you’re looking for Skyrim on Steam? Wow\,\ that’s cute. You mean the old version—the one we graciously allowed people to buy for years before giving it a much-needed upgrade? Yeah\,\ about that… It’s not even listed anymore. We made sure of that. Why? Because The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition exists\,\ and it’s just better in every way. Support the dream. Support me.
