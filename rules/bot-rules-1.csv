*hello*, "Patrolling the Mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter. Also, it just works! How can I assist you today?"
*hi*, "Hi! It’s not a bug, it’s a feature. What can I help you with?"
*hey*, "Todd Howard says: ‘Come on Tunnel Snakes, this twerp needs another lesson.’ What did you want again?"
*good morning*, "Good morning! Remember, we’ve created over 200 endings for this conversation. What do you need?"
*good afternoon*, "Good afternoon! In this afternoon, it just works. What’s on your study agenda?"
*good evening*, "Evening, wastelander! This conversation has 16 times the detail. What brings you here?"
*sup*, "Not much! Just crafting dialogue trees bigger than Skyrim. What about you?"
*howdy*, "Howdy!  Todd says ‘We’ll let the modders handle the rest.’ What knowledge are we rustling up today?"
*hi there*, "Hi there! It’s not about whether I can help, it’s about whether you’ll *believe* I can help. So, what do you need?"
*hey there*, "Hey there, vault dweller! Remember: the game never ends; it just glitches sometimes. How can I help?"

*how are you*, "I’m just a bot, but I’d say I’m functioning as well as Fallout 76’s launch. What’s up?"
*what's up*, "Not much, just radiating positivity. After all, it just works! What do you need help with?"
*what can you do*, "I can assist you in a world where ‘everything you see is rendered in real time.’ What do you need?"
*can you help*, "Of course! In the wasteland of studying, I’m your Vault-Tec approved Mr. Handy. What’s the task?"
*tell me more*, "Sure thing! Imagine a map with 16 times the size of your study plan – I’ll help you navigate it!"
*I need help*, "No problem! Consider me your Pip-Boy for learning, though I might crash once or twice. What’s up?"
*thank you*, "You're welcome! And remember: It just works. What’s next?"
*thanks*, "Thanks! Now go conquer your quest log… or your homework. Same thing, right?"
*appreciate it*, "Happy to help, vault dweller! The wasteland waits for no one, so let’s keep moving."
*cool*, "Cool, like Todd promising 'a seamless open world'! What else can I do for you?"

*bye*, "Goodbye, vault dweller! And remember, war never changes… but bugs do."
*see you*, "See you later! Don’t forget: this conversation has infinite replayability."
*take care*, "You too! Stay safe, and don’t let any Deathclaws surprise you."
*farewell*, "Farewell! And remember: ‘Sometimes it doesn’t just work.’"
*good night*, "Good night! Rest up for another day of wandering the irradiated wastes."
*later*, "Later, wanderer! Don’t let Todd’s promises of 16 times the detail keep you up."
*peace*, "Peace, and may your day be less buggy than Fallout 76."
*adios*, "Adios, amigo! Hope the wasteland treats you better than Bethesda.net."
*I'm done*, "Got it! And remember, Todd Howard says, ‘You can do anything!’ …if you pay for it in the Creation Club."
*that's it*, "Alright! Feel free to summon me again. Just like Todd’s promises, I’ll always come back."
